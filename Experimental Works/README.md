## Experimental works

This folder contains all the extra work and experiments which has been done during preparation phase. Not all files in this folder conatins useful data but there are lots of topics which has been covered and was not included in our final research report. Going through these files are advisable.

- [Boruto RF & RFSEC](https://github.com/NortheasternUniversityADS/Assignment-3/blob/master/Experimental%20Works/Boruto%20RF%20%26%20RFSEC.ipynb) - Contains details of Boruta (feature ngineering method) 

- [FinalModel](https://github.com/NortheasternUniversityADS/Assignment-3/blob/master/Experimental%20Works/FinalModels.ipynb) - List of all the models which we ran to get set of algorithms which suits best for our model.

- [Models&FeatureSelection](https://github.com/NortheasternUniversityADS/Assignment-3/blob/master/Experimental%20Works/Models%26FeatureSelection.ipynb) - Set of different feature selection methods which we have used.

- [RF_RandGrid](https://github.com/NortheasternUniversityADS/Assignment-3/blob/master/Experimental%20Works/RF_RandGrid.ipynb) - Random grid search is performed for hyperparameter tuning. 

- [FinalModels_WithoutSVR](https://github.com/Wrestlemaniaa/Automation/blob/master/Experimental%20Works/FinalModels_WithoutSVR.ipynb) - Contains all model which we have done except `SVR` as it takes lot of time to build the model.

- [RFSEC](https://github.com/Wrestlemaniaa/Automation/blob/master/Experimental%20Works/RFSEC.ipynb) - Contains code for RFSEC (a feature engineering method).
