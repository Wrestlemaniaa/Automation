## This folder contains main documents of assignment.

- [EDA](https://github.com/NortheasternUniversityADS/Assignment-3/blob/master/Main%20Assignment/EDA.ipynb) - Contains details of Exploratory Data Analysis.


- [Models](https://github.com/NortheasternUniversityADS/Assignment-3/blob/master/Main%20Assignment/Models.ipynb) - Contains details of all algorithm, their models and pickle file.

- [Summary](https://github.com/NortheasternUniversityADS/Assignment-3/blob/master/Main%20Assignment/Summarry.csv) - Final results which we got after running all models in training and testing data.


- SAV FIles - There are 5 '.sav' files. It contains data and details of all the models in biary form.

NOTE: Data in this file can not be viewed in 'github'.

- [Flask](https://github.com/Wrestlemaniaa/Automation/tree/master/Main%20Assignment/Flask) folder contains all the code which is used to create UI using `Flask API`. 

- [Algorithm & Feature Selection](https://github.com/Wrestlemaniaa/Automation/blob/master/Main%20Assignment/Algorithms%20%26%20Feature%20Selection.ipynb) - This file contains all the algorithms which we have used and methods of feature selection which is implimented.

- [Feature Engineering](https://github.com/Wrestlemaniaa/Automation/blob/master/Main%20Assignment/Feature%20Engineering.ipynb) - Contains list of all the methods which we have used for feature engineering like Boruta, RFSEC, etc.

- [Model Validation](https://github.com/Wrestlemaniaa/Automation/blob/master/Main%20Assignment/Model%20Validation.ipynb) - Contains list of all the methods which we have used for validating our model like Cross-validation, Regularization, Bias-variance tradeoff, etc.
